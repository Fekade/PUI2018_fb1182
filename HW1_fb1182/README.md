The purpose of this repository was to set up my environment for future work</br>

First a directory PUI2018 is created in /home/habtemariam/</br></br>

</br>
An environmental variable PUI2018 that "stands for" /home/habtemariam/PUI2018" is then created in my bash.rc</br>   
Finally an alias is created in my bash file</br>
