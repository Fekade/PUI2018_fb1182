I think the title of the plot is a little confusing. 
There is so much packed into the horizontal axis that I could barely read the xlable of the plot. I think reading the plot would be
much easier if in the annotation we have additional information about the 'Standardizing'. I also think, while it is a good idea to rotate the angle of the xlabel parameters, I think it should not be done all the way to 90 degrees; even reducing the number of the parameters by clustering them into a region of the city would be great, using clusters like, UWS, UES, etc.
