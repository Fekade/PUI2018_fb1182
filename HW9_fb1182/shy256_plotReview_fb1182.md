I think the title of the plot is a little confusing. 
There is so much packed into the horizontal axis that I could barely read the xlable of the plot. I think reading the plot would be
much easier if in the annotation we have additional information about the 'Standarding'. I also think, the angle of the xlabel parameters could be rotated not all the way to 90 degrees; may be even reduce the number of the parameters by clustering them in to a region of the city ? UWS, UES, etc.
